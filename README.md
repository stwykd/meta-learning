# Meta-Learning Algorithms Exploration

## Introduction

This project focuses on the exploration and implementation of various meta-learning techniques. Driven by an interest in Machine Learning applications, especially in the realm of robotics, the primary goal is to delve into and gain a deeper understanding of different meta-learning paradigms. These paradigms include black-box meta-learning, optimization-based meta-learning, and non-parametric meta-learning.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stwykd/meta-learning.git
cd meta-learning-exploration
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Usage
```bash
# TODO Instructions on how to run each algorithm or test cases
```

## Features

- **Black-Box Meta-Learning**: Implementation of Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) using the Omniglot dataset.
- **Optimization-Based Meta-Learning**: Dive into techniques like Reptile and FOMAML, tested on the Mini-ImageNet dataset.
- **Non-Parametric Meta-Learning**: Explore methods such as Matching Networks and Prototypical Networks using the TieredImageNet dataset.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. If you're looking to implement a new meta-learning technique or improve upon the existing ones, please open an issue first to discuss your ideas.

Ensure that any new implementations or modifications are accompanied by relevant test cases or documentation.
